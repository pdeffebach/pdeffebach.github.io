Recent research argues high exit rates out of wage employment, rather than low entry rates, drive low rates of wage work overall. I conduct a panel survey of job-seekers and a survey of firms in urban Ghana to explore the causes of elevated exit rates out of wage work in low-income labor markets. I document entry rates into employment are equal between the US and Ghana, but high exit rates mean Ghanaian job-seekers are only half as successful at finding wage work in the long run. In Ghana, I find exits are dominated by quits, while layoffs play a negligible role, in strong contrast with the USA, where layoffs dominate, and quits are infrequent. I examine, and reject, informational frictions as a key driver of high quit rates and show self-employment at most a moderate role. I show quits are most common among individuals who at Baseline are temporarily without flows of non-wage income. To quantify the contribution of changing non-wage income in driving quitting behavior, I build model of job search in which workers face uncertain non-wage income and accept and quit jobs to cope with temporary losses in income. When calibrated to match experience of job-seekers in both the USA and Ghana, my model attributes 20% of the difference in exit rates to this mechanism. I conclude in poor countries, wage jobs can act as insurance against risk outside the wage sector. </p> </details> <h4 id=published_papers ><a href="#published_papers" class=header-anchor >Published papers</a></h4> <p><a href="/papers/mexico.pdf"><strong>Training microentrepreneurs over Zoom: Experimental evidence from Mexico</strong></a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdeveco.2023.103244">&#40;Journal link&#41;</a></p> <p>with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/decrgdmckenzie/">David McKenzie</a>, Elwyn Davies, and Leonardo Iacovone</p> <p><em>Journal of Development Economics</em> &#40;2024&#41;</p> <details> <summary>Abstract</summary> <p class=abstract > Standard in-person business training programs are costly and difficult to scale to the millions of microenterprises in the developing world. We conduct an experiment to test the feasibility, cost-savings, and impact of delivering live training sessions over Zoom to microentrepreneurs in Mexico and Guatemala. We demonstrate that it is now feasible to both recruit and train self-employed women online, covering a wide geographic area, with few technology issues. However, the cost-savings over in-person classes are less than expected. Training improved business practices and performance over 2 months, but impacts had dissipated within 6 months. </p> </details> <h4 id=works_in_progress ><a href="#works_in_progress" class=header-anchor >Works in Progress</a></h4> <p><strong>Economic Development and the Spatial Distribution of Income in Cities</strong></p> <p>with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/davidlagakos/">David Lagakos</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/yuhei-miyauchi/home">Yuhei Miyauchi</a>, and Eiji Yamada</p> </div> </div> </div> </main>
