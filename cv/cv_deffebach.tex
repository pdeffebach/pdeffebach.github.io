\noindent \textbf{Subsistence Wage Employment: Labor Market Dynamics in Urban Ghana} (Job Market Paper)
\vspace{5pt}\\
\noindent The share of workers in wage employment is low in developing countries. Recent research argues high exit rates out of wage employment, rather than low entry rates, drive low levels of wage work overall. To shed light on the causes of elevated exit rates in low-income labor markets, I conduct a panel survey of job-seekers and a complementary survey of firms in Accra, Ghana. I document three new facts. First, exits are dominated by quits in Ghana while layoffs play a negligible role, in strong contrast to the USA where layoffs dominate and quits are infrequent. Second, workers in Ghana see income gains after quits, also in strong contrast with the USA, where workers see substantial income losses following quits. Third, I show quits are most common among job-seekers experiencing a temporary loss in non-wage income at baseline, but by endline have re-gained access to a source of income flows. I find no evidence information frictions drive exit. Instead, I argue volatility faced by workers outside the wage sector drives high exit rates and build a general equilibrium model of job search to quantify the strength of this mechanism. When calibrated to match the experience of jobseekers in both the USA and Ghana, my model attributes 25\% of the difference in exit rates to differences in the volatility of non-wage income. \\

\noindent \textbf{Economic Development and the Spatial Distribution of Income in Cities} with David Lagakos, Yuhei Miyauchi, Eiji Yamada
\vspace{5pt}\\
\noindent We draw on new granular data from cities around the world to study how the spatial distribution of income within cities varies with development. We document that in less-developed countries, average incomes of urban residents decline monotonically in distance to the city center, whereas income-distance gradients are flat or increasing in developed economies. We also show that urban neighborhoods with natural amenities  -- in hills and near rivers -- are poorer than average in less-developed countries and richer than average in developed ones. We hypothesize that these patterns arise due to the differences in the provision of residential and transportation infrastructure within cites. Using a quantitative urban model, we show that observed differences in residential and transportation infrastructure help explain a significant fraction of how the spatial income distribution within cities varies with income per capita.
