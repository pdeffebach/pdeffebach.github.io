\section*{Research}
\noindent \rule{\textwidth}{1pt} 
\noindent {\textbf{Development and the Spatial Distribution of Income in Cities} (w D. Lagakos, Y. Miyauchi, and E. Yamada)} 
\begin{customitemize}
	\item Methods: Agglomerated 30 person-level travel surveys from developing countries in Stata. Compared with administrative geo-spatial data in R. Built a quantitative urban spatial modeling in Julia
	\item Findings: Cities in poor vs. rich countries have different income sorting patterns, driven by differences in state capacity
\end{customitemize}
\noindent {\textbf{Labor Market Churn, Development, and Quits: Evidence from Urban Ghana}} 
\begin{customitemize}
\item Methods: Conducted a panel survey of job-seekers and a survey of firms in Accra, Ghana. Analyzed differences between Ghana and USA using administrative data in Stata. Built a model of job search in Julia
\item Findings: Job-seekers find jobs easily, but then quit at enormous rates. Wage work is a temporary tool to get through hard times 
\end{customitemize}
\noindent {\textbf{Training Microentrepreneurs over Zoom: Experimental Evidence from Mexico} (w D. McKenzie, E. Davies, and L. Iacovone)} 
\begin{customitemize}
	\item Methods: Analysis of RCT. Designed heterogeneous treatment effect estimation using machine learning methods
	\item Findings: Zoom training improves business practices and profits in the short run, but effects fade over time
	\item Published in \textit{The Journal of Development Economics}
