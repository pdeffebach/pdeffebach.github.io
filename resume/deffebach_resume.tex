\section*{\sc{Education}}
\noindent \rule{\textwidth}{1pt} 
\noindent {\textbf{Boston University, PhD in Economics}}  \hfill Expected June 2025
\begin{customitemize}
	\item Development, Macroeconomics, and Urban Economics $\big |$ Advised by David Lagakos, Yuhei Miyauchi, and Masao Fukui
\end{customitemize}
\noindent {\textbf{Princeton University, AB in Economics}}  \hfill June 2017
\begin{customitemize}
	\item Economics Major, Spanish Minor, \textit{Cum laude}
\end{customitemize}

\section*{\sc{Selected Dissertation Research}}
\noindent \rule{\textwidth}{1pt} 
\noindent {\textbf{Labor Market Churn, Development, and Quits: Evidence from Urban Ghana} (Job Market Paper)} 
\begin{customitemize}
\item Methods: Conducted a panel survey of job-seekers and a survey of firms in Accra, Ghana. Analyzed differences between Ghana and USA using administrative data in Stata. Built a model of job search in Julia
\item Findings: Job-seekers find jobs easily, but then quit at enormous rates. Wage work is a temporary tool to get through hard times 
\end{customitemize}
\noindent {\textbf{Development and the Spatial Distribution of Income in Cities} (With D. Lagakos, Y. Miyauchi, and E. Yamada)} 
\begin{customitemize}
	\item Methods: Agglomerated 30 person-level travel surveys from developing countries in Stata. Compared with administrative geo-spatial data in R. Built a quantitative urban spatial modeling in Julia
	\item Findings: Cities in poor vs. rich countries have different income sorting patterns, driven by differences in underlying state capacity
\end{customitemize}
\noindent {\textbf{Training Microentrepreneurs over Zoom: Experimental Evidence from Mexico} (With D. McKenzie, E. Davies, and L. Iacovone)} 
\begin{customitemize}
	\item Methods: Analysis of RCT. Designed heterogeneous treatment effect estimation using machine learning methods
	\item Findings: Zoom training improves business practices and profits in the short run, but effects fade over time
	\item Published in \textit{The Journal of Development Economics}
\end{customitemize}

\section*{\sc{Work Experience}} 
\noindent \rule{\textwidth}{1pt}

\noindent \textbf{Research Associate --- Professor Chris Blattman at U. of Chicago and Innovations for Poverty Action}  \hfill 2017--2020 
\begin{customitemize}
	\item Worked with household survey data, administrative crime data, censuses, GIS, and qualitative interviews in Stata, R, Python, and Matlab. Studied policy experiments with randomization inference, synthetic control, and partial identification
	\item Managed a team of Master's students to set project timelines and ensure code quality 
	\item Traveled to Colombia to design and pilot surveys on the role of criminal gangs in the daily life of lower-income neighborhoods in Medellin. Met with policymakers and academics to design a non-policing intervention to improve security in Medellin
